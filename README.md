# Game of Thrones Banner Build

Use the in-class build as your starting point, and finish developing the application to
the specs provided. Use modern web development best practices (Terminal, Git /
Github, JavaScript) to create an up-and-running app with custom video controls
and lightbox functionality.

## Description

Add the final house sigils and video to your app; update the JS as required. Each sigil image should trigger a side-scrolling animation. When the animation is complete, the lightbox should open, containing the House video including custom controls. The lightbox
should close when the video reaches its end. Show the related Great House information on the page, using an array to hold that data
and retrieving it when the banner animation is done. The heading should update as well, and display the name of the current House.
